# freeCodeCamp Quality Assurance Certificate

These are the projects I did in the completion of this certificate.

## Projects

### Metric-Imperial Converter

Allows converting between various units of measurement including gal, L, etc. I wrote both the functionality (conversion logic and routes) as well as unit and functional tests utilizing the Chai library.

### Issue Tracker

Tracks issues for projects. An issue can be created with a title, description, and other information. This information can be updated and the issue itself can be deleted. I used a MongoDB database to store issues, Express to handle routes, and did functional tests utilizing the Chai library.

### Personal Library

A library to hold information on books. Each book contains a title and comments. I used a MongoDB database to store books, Express to handle routes, and did functional tests utilizing the Chai library.
